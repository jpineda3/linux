What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/out_altvoltageY_filter_high_pass_3db_frequency
KernelVersion:	5.13.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The cut-off frequency of the ADMV8818 high pass filter. The value is scaled using
		the `out_altvoltageY_scale` attribute so that GHz frequencies are valid inputs,
		The accepted range of values for the frequencies is between 1.75GHz and 19.9GHz.

		The default value for the scale is 1000000, therefore MHz frequency values are
		passed as input.

Description:
		The cut-off frequency of the ADMV8818 low pass filter. The value is scaled using
		the `out_altvoltageY_scale` attribute so that GHz frequencies are valid inputs,
		The accepted range of values for the frequencies is between 2.05GHz and 18.85GHz.

		The default value for the scale is 1000000, therefore MHz frequency values are
		passed as input.
